%%% Definitions
word -- string with the ortographic form of the word
pron -- string with the phonetic transcription of the word
new_pron -- string with the modified pronunciation
dict -- dictionary with all CMU words as keys and pron as values

%%% Transform all plosives into their non-aspirated counterparts
replace all [p] in the corpus by [pp]
replace all [t] in the corpus by [tt]
replace all [k] in the corpus by [kk]

%%% Now generate the aspirated pronunciations
for word, pron in dict:

 %%% Rules after Cardoso (2011)
 %%% Stops in stressed syllables are aspirated
 if pron has [pp] in a stressed syllable and not [s pp ..1]: % e.g.  pop 
   replace [pp] by [p ..1] and append new_pron to dict
 elif pron has [tt] in a stressed syllable and not [s tt ..1]: % e.g.  pop 
   replace [tt] by [t ..1] and append new_pron to dict  
 elif pron has [kk ..1] in a stressed syllable and not [s kk ..1]: % e.g.  pop 
   replace [kk ..1] by [k ..1] and append new_pron to dict

 %%% Stops in stressed word initial positions are aspirated
 elif pron has [$pp]: % e.g.  tab 
   replace [$pp] by [$p] and append new_pron to dict
 elif pron has [$tt]: % e.g.  tab 
   replace [$tt] by [$t] and append new_pron to dict  
 elif pron has [$k]: % e.g.  tab 
   replace [$kk] by [$k] and append new_pron to dict
