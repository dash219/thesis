Data from the World Economic Outlook, of the IMF (2013), list currently Brazil as the seventh largest economy in the world, with a GDP of US\$ 2,396 trillions. According to a survey by The Economist (2013), since 2009, the growth of BRICS (emerging market economies group formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) accounts for 55\% of the world economy growth. The current economic scenario is extremely favorable for Brazil to increase its global influence.

However, with regard to the ability to communicate globally, we occupy a much more modest position. In the \ac{EF-EPI} of 2014, which is published by \ac{EF}, Brazil was ranked in the 38\textsuperscript{th} position out of 63 countries, classified among countries with low English proficiency, with $49.96$ points \cite{EF2014}. The full ranking is shown in \autoref{fig:ef-epi-ranking}.

        \label{fig:ef-epi-ranking}
\end{figure}

As can be noticed from \autoref{fig:ef-epi-ranking}, Brazil was immediately behind two other countries from the BRICS, Russia ($50.44$) and China ($50.15$); and near several other Latin America countries, such as Peru ($51.46$), Ecuador ($51.05$), Uruguay ($49.61$), Chile ($48.75$) and Colombia ($48.54$). 

Scandinavian countries lead the very high proficiency rankings, with Denmark ($69.30$) in the first position, Sweden ($67.30$) in third the spot, Finland ($64.40$) in the fourth and Norway ($64.33$) in the fifth. All these countries have a very high \ac{HDI}, according to the United Nations Development Programme. The \ac{HDI} measures the social and economic development by analyzing three indexes: educational level, average income and longevity. The top five in the \ac{EF-EPI} rankings are among the top twelve countries in terms of \ac{HDI} \cite{HDI2014}. The \ac{EF-EPI} data showed that there is a moderate to strong correlation between \ac{HDI} and English proficiency (R=0.67) \cite{EF2014}. The second position in the \ac{EF-EPI} ranking is held by the Netherlands, scoring $68.99$ points. The Netherlands has the fourth largest \ac{HDI} in the world. This result is similar to that of the previous versions of \ac{EF-EPI} \cite{EF2013, EF2012, EF2011}, which also showed a prevalence of Northern European countries in the best positions.

It is interesting to notice that four of the countries at the top five share a common cultural Germanic heritage and speak a language of the Germanic family -- the same branch that English is part of. Since Danish, Swedish, Norse, Dutch and English are related through descent from a common ancestor, Proto-Germanic, they inevitably share many linguistic characteristics, such as sound correspondences, a large number of cognates, similar morphology and syntax, etc. This might be an advantage of these countries in comparison to the remaining.

The high proficiency band is occupied mainly by other European countries, both in the Eastern and Western part, such as Estonia (61.39), Belgium (61.21), Germany (60.89), Slovenia (60.60), Latvia (59.43) and Switzerland (58.29). Two Southeast Asian countries also figure within this range, namely Malaysia (59.73) and Singapore (59.58). This result might seem a bit biased since English is one of the official languages in Singapore, along with Malay, Mandarin and Tamil; it is considered the language of business, government, and the medium of instruction in school. We shall highlight Argentina's performance. Despite the great economic depression from 1998 to 2002, Argentina was still able to outperform Brazil, scoring $59.02$ points, being the only country from Latin America among the ones with high proficiency. 

The moderate proficiency range is filled by the remaining European countries, such as Czech Republic (57.42), Slovakia (55.96), the countries from the Iberian Peninsula -- Spain (57.18) and Portugal (56.83)--, together with France (52.69) and Italy (52.80). In addition, the majority of Asian countries which were analyzed in the survey also figure in this list. South Korea achieved the best performance among them, with 53.62 points. India comes next, scoring 53.54 points. The rest of the list is occupied by Japan (52.88), Indonesia (52.74), Taiwan (52.56) and Hong Kong (52.50).

The \ac{EF-EPI} bands are aligned to the \ac{CEFR}, which is a guideline proposed by the Council of Europe to describe achievements of learners of foreign languages across the European Union. The \ac{CEFR} reference levels are described in \autoref{tab:cefr-levels}. \ac{EF-EPI} bands are mapped into \ac{CEFR} reference levels as follows: the very high proficiency band corresponds to \ac{CEFR} level B2; very low proficiency to A2; high, moderate and low proficiency bands to B1 with different punctuations.

In case, Brazil's low proficiency rank is analogous to the \ac{CEFR} B1 level. To put another way, it means that Brazilians are usually able to communicate in English with intermediate skills, being able to understand familiar matters, deal with traveling situations, describe personal experiences and plans, and produce simple texts about subjects of personal interest. As one might observe this is a very restricted communicative competence, which limits English usage basically to the personal domain. To get an idea, the \ac{CEFR} lists four broad domains: educational, occupational, public, and personal. So Brazilians lacks linguistic abilities in at least three broad domains, this linguistic competence would not allow one to perceive or produce English utterances flexibly, either for social, academic or professional purposes. The performance for each state can be found at the map in \autoref{fig:ef-epi-brazil-map}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

        \caption{EF EPI scores for each Brazilian state.}
        \label{fig:ef-epi-brazil-map}
\end{figure}

As one might see from \autoref{fig:ef-epi-brazil-map}, one can clearly see division between Southern and Northern Brazil. Ten states achieved very low proficiency, namely Amazonas, Acre, Par\'a, Roraima, Piau\'i, Alagoas, Tocantins, Rond\^onia, Maranh\~ao and Mato Grosso. The highest scores are found among the richest Brazilian states, mainly in the Southeast and the South regions. The top position is held by S\~ao Paulo, which has the largest population, the highest number of industries, and most part of the economic production in the country. Rio de Janeiro, which is the second largest economy of Brazil, occupies the second position. Paran\'a is the third best ranked state. These three states are the only in the country that achieved moderate proficiency, they attained a score that is at least $4.8\%$ above the country's average, and all of them are among those with the highest \ac{HDI}.

With respect of Business English proficiency, our performance is even more concerning. On the 
2013 \ac{BEI}, conducted by \citeauthor{BEI2013} \cite{BEI2013}, Brazil reached the 71\textsuperscript{st} position out of 77 countries analyzed. The ranking is described in \autoref{fig:bei-ranking}. Brazil attained a score of $3.27$ points, in a scale from $1$ to $10$, being placed at the ``Beginner'' range, the lowest proficiency range considered by the index. Brazil's performance was close to that of El Salvador ($3.24$), Saudi Arabia ($3.14$) and Honduras ($2.92$) which up until recently had experienced civil wars or dictatorship governments. The ``Beginner'' is described as:
\begin{description}
  \item[Beginner:] Can read and communicate using only simple questions and statements, but can't communicate and understand basic business information during phone calls.
\end{description}
Again, we can see that this is a very limited linguistic competence, that would not allow one not even to perform the most elementary day-to-day tasks in a company or industry work environment.

\end{figure}

Given this scenario, it is clear that we desperately need to improve English language proficiency among Brazilians. This project seeks to be an initial step in that direction. We proposed a method for building a non-native speech recognizer and checker, called Listener, which is capable of recognizing utterances in Brazilian-accented English and identifying which are the mispronunciations. Our system might be used to build \ac{CAPT} systems for Brazilian-accented English. We also delivered a prototype \ac{CAPT} system to illustrate how it might work.

Similar tools have been developed for other languages, such as Japanese \cite{Tsubota2004}, Spanish \cite{Reis2011}, Dutch \cite{Strik2009} and French \cite{GenevaLogic2006}. However for \ac{BP}, to the best of our knowledge, there is still a gap to be explored.

\ac{CAPT} systems can provide new opportunities for practicing oral proficiency. With respect to L2 pronunciation, it has been shown that when students have online corrective feedback about their mispronunciations, they can improve more quality their pronunciation skills \cite{Long1983, Lyster2010}. Nonetheless, in the classroom, teachers are not not always able to provide this type of individual feedback given the number of students in a class and the amount of available hours in a \ac{ESL} course. \ac{CAPT} systems can be a solution are able to assist with this matter, since they  can assess one's pronunciation in real time at very low cost. According to \citeauthor{Neri2008} \cite{Neri2008}, by using \ac{CAPT}, students are able improve their pronunciation skills a similar pace to those who attend traditional classrooms.

\section{Research hypotheses}

The research hypotheses are:

About the acoustic model:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item cross-linguistic acoustic models, estimated from native data -- in case, \ac{BP} and English -- are suitable for recognizing Brazilian-accented English;
 \item a small amount of data from Brazilian-accented English might be used, through speaker adaptation, to increase the recognition performance;
 \item phonetically rich corpora are more appropriate for building acoustic models which will be used for forced alignment tasks than balanced corpora.
\end{enumerate}
About the pronunciation dictionary:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Brazilian-accented negative transfer phenomena can be represented through transformation rules;
 \item non-native pronunciation variants can be handled similarly to native variation, by using a  multi-pronunciation dictionary;
 \item phones which are acoustically similar in English and \ac{BP} might be merged in the pronunciation dictionary to improve the recognition performance.
\end{enumerate}
About the speech recognizer and checker:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item an HMM/GMM \ac{ASR}, with acoustic parameters estimated from a cross-linguistic corpora (from both English and \ac{BP}), with a multi-pronunciation dictionary which include Brazilian-accented variants created through transformation rules, is an adequate method for recognizing and identifying mispronunciations in forced alignment tasks containing Brazilian-accented English.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Contributions of the Thesis}

Within this work, I have investigated and developed a set of tools and resources for non-native speech recognition and correction, focused on Brazilian-accented English. Some of these resources and tools are exclusively for tasks related to processing Brazilian-accented English, but others are more general and can be employed for many other purposes, such as a \ac{G2P} for \ac{BP}, corpus balancing, etc. The full list of contributions is provided below:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \emph{Aeiouad\^o G2P}: A grapheme-to-phoneme converter for \ac{BP} which uses a hybrid approach, based on both handcrafted rules and machine learning method, as decribed in \citeauthor{Mendonca2014} \cite{Mendonca2014};
 \item \emph{Aeiouad\^o dictionary}: A large machine readable dictionary for \ac{BP}, compiled from a word list extracted from the Portuguese Wikipedia, which was preprocessed in order to filter loanwords, acronyms, scientific names and other spurious data, and then transcribed with Aeiouad\^o G2P).
 \item A method for the extraction of phonetically rich sentences, i.e. sentences with a high variety of triphones distributed in a uniform fashion, which employs a greedy algorithm for comparing triphone distributions among sentences, as described in \citeauthor{Mendonca2014b} \cite{Mendonca2014b};
 \item A phonetic speller for user-generated content in \ac{BP}, based on machine learning, which takes advantage of Aeiouad\^o G2P to group phonetically related words, as described in \citeauthor{Mendonca2015} \cite{Mendonca2015}; 
 \item A set of rules for generating pronunciation hypothesis for Brazilian-accented English, considering nine types of mispronunciations, respectively: (i) syllable simplification; (ii) consonant change; (iii) deaspiration of voiceless plosives in initial or stressed positions; (iv) terminal devoicing in word-final obstruents; (v) delateralization and rounding of lateral liquids in final position; (vi) vocalization of final nasals; (vii) velar consonantal paragoge; (viii) vowel assimilation; (ix) interconsonantal epenthesis;
 \item An alignment method for phonetic transcriptions which takes into the phones' distinctive features for finding the optimal phone sequence match;
 \item A crowdsourced platform for speeding up the process of compiling and transcribing speech corpora;
 \item \emph{Listener}:A prototype system for automatic speech recognition and evaluation of Brazilian-accented English, which makes use of forced alignment, \ac{HMM}/\ac{GMM} acoustic models, context free grammars and multipronunciation dictionaries;
\end{enumerate}
