\section{Feedback} 
Many papers have confirmed the importance of feedback for adequate learning in second language
acquisition. Negative feedback has been investigated by (XXXXX) and positive feedback by (XXXXX).
For \ac{CAPT} systems the feedback to the user may be provided by many media: text, voice or video.

Definitely, the more complex and informative form of feedback is through video. \citeauthor{Badin2010} \citep{Badin2010}
developed a 3D talking head, that is able to display the articulation in an augmented mode,
by showing all major speech articulators, including those usually hidden such as the tongue or the velum. The talking
was called OroFacial Clone, and an example of its display can be found in \autoref{fig:badin-orofacial-clone}.

\end{figure}

The model is based on acustic-to-articulatory inversion and was built upon estimating speech articulators' 
movement from \ac{MRI}, \ac{CT} and video data. As one can imagine, building such a model is a very expensive task, which 
requires not only \ac{CG} and speech processing expertise, but also access to high-priced medical devices, such as 
\ac{MRI} scanners and tomographs. 

Part of this system was evaluated by \citeauthor{Wang2014} \citep{Wang2014} in a \ac{CAPT} context, by testing the
performance of Chinese learners of French. The aim of the test was to analyse performance of the learners in the production 
of French vowels that do not exist in the Chinese phoneset. The authors found that the students that were exposed to 
audiovisual stimuli improved their pronunciation more than the ones that were exposed only to auditory stimuli.
